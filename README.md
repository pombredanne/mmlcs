# mmlcs
Multi multi longest common substring, or something that sounds like that.

# Background
[Longest Common Substring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring_problem)
is a well known problem within Computer Science. It's defined as taking two
strings as input and returns the one, single longest substring that both strings
contain. Multi Longest Common Substring is defined as having two or more
strings and returning the one, single longest substring that is contained
within all the inputs. In MMLCS, we have two or more input strings and
return many substrings that are contained in two or more of the inputs.
